# Go Serial

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mikepb/go-serial?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mikepb/go-serial)

Package serial provides a binding to libserialport for serial port
functionality. Serial ports are commonly used with embedded systems,
such as the Arduino platform.

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/mikepb/go-serial"
  "log"
)

func main() {
  options := serial.RawOptions
  options.BitRate = 115200
  p, err := options.Open("/dev/tty")
  if err != nil {
    log.Panic(err)
  }

  defer p.Close()

  buf := make([]byte, 1)
  if _, err := p.Read(buf); err != nil {
    log.Panic(err)
  } else {
    log.Println(buf)
  }
}
```
